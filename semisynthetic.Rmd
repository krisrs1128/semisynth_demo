- Write a simulator based on real data. Use a simple ground truth - exponential
tilting whose $\beta$ wasn't originally fitted to anything
- Simulate from a few rescalings of the ground truth
- Fit to each simulated dataset using LNM
- Rank treatment effects and estimate false / true positive rates
